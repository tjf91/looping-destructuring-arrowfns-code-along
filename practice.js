////////// OBJECT DESTRUCTURING //////////

/*
Object destructuring allows you to "unpack" properties from objects and assign them to variables
An example of this is the object numbers as seen in the code
On line 96, the variables one, two and three are receiving the property values from the numbers object
This is the process called destructuring

Above you are given the object animalCount
Destructure this object so that you have 3 distinct variables with values matching those of the properties from animalCount
*/

// Code here

////////// PROBLEM 6 //////////

/*
Now that you have some experience with destructuring, we will take it one step further
Instead of using a variable to assign values, we will use an object literal
The commented code below is an example of this
*/

// const {one, two, three} = {one: '1', two: '2', three: '3'}

/*
For this problem, create an object literal to assign variables a value through destructuring
These variables should be: students, mentors and instructors

////////// PROBLEM 8 //////////

/*
We will now be implementing object destructuring using functions
See the below commented code for an example

Here we have an object called nums and a function called addition
In this function, we are using object destructuring to unpack the objects values and assign them to new variables

If we were to invoke the addition function and pass in the nums object, the returned value would be 6

////////// PROBLEM 10 //////////

/*
Now that you've practiced object destructuring inside of a function with that function's parameter, we will take it one step further
Instead of using object destructuring inside of the function, we can declare a destructured object as our parameter
See below for an example
The function immediatelyDestructured has a parameter that is a destructured object
This is useful because we can immediately use the variables one, two and three in the function instead of having to destructure the object parameter inside of the function
If we were to invoke the function and pass in the exampleObj object below, the returned value would be 6
